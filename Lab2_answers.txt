1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

When the number of hidden nodes is very low (e.g., 1–2), the decision boundary becomes overly simplistic, resulting in underfitting, poor data representation, and low accuracy. When the number of nodes is increased (e.g., around 5–20), the model has greater flexibility, enabling it to fit patterns in the data more successfully, thereby enhancing accuracy. When the hidden layer is made very large (e.g., around 50 nodes), the network can nearly perfectly fit the training data, often resulting in close to 100% training accuracy, but this makes the network highly susceptible to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but generalizes poorly to new, unseen data.



2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

The trend in accuracy varies with the hidden layer size. When the hidden layer is small, the model underfits, and accuracy is low. When the size of the hidden layer is moderate (between 4–20 nodes), accuracy generally peaks because the model has a good trade-off between flexibility and generalization. But when the hidden layer is very large (50 or more nodes), training accuracy is high, but accuracy on new data can plateau or even decrease because of overfitting.
